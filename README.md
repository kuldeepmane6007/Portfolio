# Portfolio
A portfolio web page is created by following these key steps:

1.Planning: Decide the structure (e.g., Home, About, Projects, Contact) and design (colors, fonts) for the page.

2.Choosing Technology:
No-code platforms (like Wix or WordPress) for beginners.
HTML/CSS for custom structure and styling.
JavaScript for interactivity (optional).
Frameworks (React, Vue) for advanced features (optional).

3.Building the Page:
HTML: Create sections for content (Home, Projects, Contact, etc.).
CSS: Style the page (fonts, colors, layout).
JavaScript: Add interactivity, like form submissions or animations.

4.Adding Content: Upload your projects, write a short bio, and provide contact information or links to your resume.

5.Testing: Ensure the site is responsive (mobile-friendly) and works across different browsers.
